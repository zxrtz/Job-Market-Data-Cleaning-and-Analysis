# Job-Market-ETL-and-Analysis
Utilizing MySQL, extract, transfer, and load (ETL) job market data to cleanse and standardize data for analysis. Analysis of job market to measure layoff data against company performance.


First, I transformed cleaned job market layoff data to remove duplicates, remove blank and irrelevant data, and modified fields to prepare for analysis. 
This is in the file named data_cleaning.sql.

Below you can see Exploratory Data Analysis for the companies in the top 5 for the number layoffs per year.
This is just an example of the exploring that I have done with CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, etc.
This is compiled in the file named EDA.sql
